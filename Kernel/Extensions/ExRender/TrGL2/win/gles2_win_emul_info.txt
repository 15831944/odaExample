Here could be added gles_sdk OpenGL ES 2.0 ATI emulator for Windows:
http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/graphics-development/amd-opengl-es-sdk/

CMake will automatically found availability of gles_sdk folder in win directory and add GLES2 device into Visual Studio solution with full emulation configuration instead of compatibility configuration.
