    A knot vector defines a sequence of parameter values that determine where and how 
    the control points affect the curve curve. The knot vector is a sequence of parameter 
    values and divides the parametric space into intervals, usually called knot spans.

    (0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3) can be valid while (0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3) cannot be valid.
    Knot vector does not affect the form of the nurb curve, it only affects its parameterization.
    
    The control points specify the placement of the curve and adjust its shape.
    
    A rational spline is constructed, and controlPoints.length() must equal weights.length()
    If isPeriodic is false, then knots.length() must equal controlPoints.length() + degree + 1
    If isPeriodic is true, then knots.length() must equal controlPoints.length(), the first and last controlPoints must be equal
    and the first and last weights (if provided) must be equal.
