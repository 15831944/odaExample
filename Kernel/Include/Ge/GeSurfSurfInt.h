/** \details
    This class holds the intersection data of two surfaces.

    \remarks
    This object contains references to surface objects but does not own them.
    Calculation of the intersection is performed by a query function.

    Any output geometry from an intersection object is owned by the caller.
    The const base objects returned by surface1() and surface2() are not considered output objects.

    If one of the objects is deleted, the intersection must be recalculated.
    If one of the object is NULL, kXXUnknown status is set and zero value is returned.
