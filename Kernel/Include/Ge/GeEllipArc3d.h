/** \details
  This class represents 3D elliptical arcs and full ellipses in 3D space.

  \remarks
  The angle of a point on an ellipse is measured by projecting the point along a
  vector perpendicular to the major axis onto a circle whose center is the
  center of this ellipse and whose radius is the major radius of this ellipse.
  The angle between the major axis of the ellipse and a vector from the center
  of the ellipse to the intersection point with the circle, measured
  counterclockwise about the crossproduct of the major and minor axes, is the
  angle of the point on the ellipse.
