    of revisions. Together with applyPatch() it is designed to transfer changes
    between storages.

    The "from" set of revisions is considered available in the remote storage.
    So, the objects reachable by these commits should not be included in the
    patch. The "to" set of revisions are the revisions that need to be made
    available on the remote. Each names a single revision to be included. So,
    if all revisions of a branch need to be included, then each revision from
    that branch needs to included in the "to" set.

    Consider following example scenarios:

    Remote:        -- C7
                 /
    C0 -- C1 -- C2 -------- C5 -- C6

    translated on the remote to 'makePatch({C3}, {C6})'. This will only include
    the differences between revision C3 and revision C6 into the patch.

    If the local repository has two branches up to C2, C3 (C0, C1, C2, C3) and
    wants to pull the remote changes up to C6, it makes a request to the remote
    'pull({C2, C3}, master)' which is translated on the remote to
    'makePatch({C0, C1, C2, C3}, {C4, C5, C6})'. This will include all objects
    from C4, C5 and C6 in the patch not already available in any of the local
    branches.

    This can also be used for the initial clone of a repository by making a
    request to the remote 'pull({}, master)' which is thus translated to
    'makePatch({}, {C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6})' which does not include C7 or
