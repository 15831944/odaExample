   This class contains methods performing Boolean operations
   on 2-D regions and lines
  
   \remarks
   Regions are given by bounding contours. Contours must be closed and should not 
   be self-intersecting.
   CCW contour represents region inside it, and CW contour - outside.
   Lines are given by contours too, but the contours can be closed or not and can 
   intersect each other.
